# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The project follows **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for professional, predictable version control numbering.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-15

> [!TIP]
> Versioning is now centralized in `gui/version.py` and displayed inside the GUI (title bar and About dialog).

> [!NOTE]
> Quality checks: run `python -m compileall gui` for a fast lint-like syntax sweep and start the GUI with `python gui/main.py` for a smoke test.

- Added centralized version constant and surfaced it in the window title and About dialog.
- Introduced this changelog file to document releases.
- Documented lightweight lint/test commands with color-highlighted callouts in the README.
